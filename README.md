# ARGA
Adaptive Robust Genetic Algorithm

Adaptive Robust Genetic Algorithm (ARGA) optimizes zero-one simulation problems by incorporating input uncertainty. In ARGA, a surviving population of solutions evolves as more information about the high-dimensional problem affected by stochasticity becomes available. A ranking and selection operation in each iteration is enhanced with a debiasing mechanism of fitness values using fast iterated bootstraps and control variates. Debiasing reduces the model risk from input uncertainty bias, obtaining a more accurate ranking of the current surviving solutions. Given the double loop of function evaluations, we adaptively increase budget only if the current populationâ€™s proximity to optimality signals the need for a smaller standard error. In that case, we allocate additional replications to the input model of a current surviving solution that is most responsible for risk. The empirical results with a fixed optimization budget demonstrate that ARGA obtains significantly better solutions in a feature selection problem on various datasets.
